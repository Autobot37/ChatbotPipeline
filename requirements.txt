#okay so here comes my plan makin ass.
STT 
1. colored text
2. Real time
3. will explore till diart.

QNA
current seems best

TTS
some prompting

Dataset, some good features, to upfate every time.
so yeah.

So it is for now, real time, asr.

one thing is to decide how far to go, for example, i will not go into writing cpp domain for now ,idk i may go.
but like deciding small part and jumoing i will cover this mans whole life work.
and certainly will not go to more research side like reaing papers and just glancinga nd graph ml nets kind of stuff.
